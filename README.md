# Single Perceptron in Python


This is a simple implementation of a single perceptron algorithm in Python. It can be used to train a binary classifier for any given dataset. The model can learn to classify inputs into one of two possible output classes (+1 or -1) based on the weights and biases. The code has visualization capabilities to visualize the training process and decision boundary using Matplotlib. The purpose of this code is to provide a simple implementation of the perceptron algorithm and to showcase how to train and visualize the decision boundary for a simple binary classification problem.

# Usage
To use this implementation, start by installing the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Next, create a Perceptron object and provide the number of inputs and learning rate (optional) as arguments.
